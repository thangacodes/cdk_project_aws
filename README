==================

What is AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit)?
AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) is an open-source software development framework that allows you to define cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages like TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Java, and C#. With AWS CDK, you can model your cloud resources as code and deploy them using AWS CloudFormation.

Coming to the project repo,
This project repository contains the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) and includes an Ansible playbook that sets up a local environment. 
It initializes a custom CDK project, creates necessary folders, and activates a virtual environment, among other tasks.

To initialize the project, navigate to the ansible_script folder and follow the procedure below:
$ cd ansible_script
$ ansible-playbook init_cdk_project.yaml
